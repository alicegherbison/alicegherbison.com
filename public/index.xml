      <description>Go back home   About this site Last updated: Saturday, 2nd June 2018
Even though this site is tiny without much content at the moment, I want every design and code decision I make to meet the following two principles:
 Lean and fast as possible - no unnecessary frameworks or third-party scripts, and no design decisions that contradict this Accessible - meets WCAG 2.0 AAA criteria and validates by W3C with no errors  This is also a learning exercise to deepen my own understanding of web best practices and development tools.</description>
