I'm **Alice**, a **user experience developer** based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I'm currently available for work and am seeking a **front end development** role in a supportive environment where my user experience design skills are valued. 

I'm skilled in:

* building prototypes in code
* defining information architecture and site structures
* content strategy and CMS planning
* running usability tests
* conducting primary user research and interviews
* translating requirements into acceptance criteria

I've rebuilt this website from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
