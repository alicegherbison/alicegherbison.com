Hi, I'm **Alice** - a **front-end engineer** based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Most recently, I worked at [i-immersive](https://www.i-immersive.co.uk), building [ClassView](https://app.classview.com), a video conferencing web/desktop application for the education sector, in **React** and **TypeScript**.

I've spent the last year on sabbatical living (and studying at language school) in **Seoul, South Korea**.

I have an **MSc** in **human computer interaction** and an undergraduate degree in psychology.
