I'm **Alice**, a **front-end developer** based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I'm highly **detailed-oriented, empathetic and passionate** about learning new skills and web technologies.

I build **accessible, responsive and friendly** interfaces that meet both **user and client needs**.

I'm currently **open to front-end opportunities** (remote or Edinburgh-based) using React and Typescript.

My most recent experience has been building [Vscene](https://vscene.net/en-gb/), a video conferencing web/desktop application for the education sector.

I have a **MSc** in **human computer interaction** and an undergraduate degree in psychology.
