*Last build: {{< build-date >}}*

Even though my website is tiny without much content, I want every design and code decision to meet the following two principles:

1. Lean and fast as possible - no unnecessary frameworks or third-party scripts, and no design decisions that contradict this
2. Accessible - meets WCAG 2.0 AA criteria and validates by W3C with no errors

## Goals

* Statically generated ✓
* Stored on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alicegherbison) ✓
