*Last build: {{< build-date >}}*

Even though my website is tiny without much content at the moment, I want every design and code decision to meet the following two principles:

1. Lean and fast as possible - no unnecessary frameworks or third-party scripts, and no design decisions that contradict this
2. Accessible - meets WCAG 2.0 AA criteria and validates by W3C with no errors

This is also a learning exercise to deepen my own understanding of web best practices and development tools. And have some fun.

## Goal

* ~~Version controlled with Git~~ ~~(using Git Flow)~~
* ~~Something statically generated~~
* ~~Stored on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alicegherbison)~~
* ~~Served via a CDN~~
* ~~Served over HTTPS~~
* Using SASS ~~(has some CSS)~~
* ~~Everything properly minified~~
* ~~Built with a pipeline tool~~

## Reality
