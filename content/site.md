*Last build: {{< build-date >}}*

Even though my website is tiny without much content, I want every design and code decision to meet the following two principles:

1. Lean and fast as possible - no unnecessary frameworks or third-party scripts, and no design decisions that contradict this
2. Accessible - meets WCAG 2.0 AA criteria and validates by W3C with no errors

## Goals

* Version controlled with Git &check;
* Statically generated &check;
* Stored on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/alicegherbison) &check;
* Served via a CDN &check;
* Served over HTTPS &amp; HTTP/2 &check;
* Everything minified &check;
* Built with a pipeline tool &check;

## Reality

Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (v.{{< version >}}) employing Hugo Pipes for CSS minification. [Source code](https://github.com/alicegherbison/alicegherbison.com) on GitHub &amp; deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Domain &amp; email forwarding by [Hostpresto](https://hostpresto.com/my/aff.php?aff=289). Colour scheme from [Monokai Pro](https://www.monokai.pro/).
