		<h1>About this site</h1>
		<p><em>Last updated: Saturday, 2nd June 2018</em></p>
		<p>Even though this site is tiny without much content at the moment, I want every design and code decision I make to meet the following two principles:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Lean and fast as possible - no unnecessary frameworks or third-party scripts, and no design decisions that contradict this</li>
			<li>Accessible - meets WCAG 2.0 AAA criteria and validates by W3C with no errors</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This is also a learning exercise to deepen my own understanding of web best practices and development tools.</p>
		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Version controlled, stored on <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
			<li>Something statically generated (<a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>?) served via a CDN (<a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a>?)</li>
			<li>Using SASS and a pipeline tool (<a href="https://gulpjs.com" target="_blank">Gulp</a>?)</li>
			<li>Served over HTTPS</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Reality</h2>
		<p>A few completely static and non-templated HTML files. Domain and hosting by <a href="https://hostpresto.com/my/aff.php?aff=289">Hostpresto</a>, written in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>.</p>
