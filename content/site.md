Even though my website is tiny without much content at the moment, I want every design and code decision to meet the following two principles:

1. Lean and fast as possible - no unnecessary frameworks or third-party scripts, and no design decisions that contradict this
2. Accessible - meets WCAG 2.0 AA criteria and validates by W3C with no errors

This is also a learning exercise to deepen my own understanding of web best practices and development tools. And have some fun.

## Goal

* ~~Version controlled with Git~~
* ~~Something statically generated~~
* ~~Stored on <a href="https://www.github.com/alicegherbison" target="_blank">GitHub</a>~~
* ~~Served via a CDN~~
* ~~Served over HTTPS~~
* Using SASS ~~(has some CSS)~~
* Built with a pipeline tool (<a href="https://gulpjs.com" target="_blank">Gulp</a>?)

## Reality

Built using <a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>. <a href="https://github.com/alicegherbison/alicegherbison.com" target="_blank">Source code</a> on GitHub &amp; deployed via <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.
